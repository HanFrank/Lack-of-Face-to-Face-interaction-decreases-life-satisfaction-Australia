abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of many in ways that go beyond just physical health, as people’s mental health has also been largely impacted. Using data provided from Australia’s General Social Survey, distributions were created and analyzed to determine how the lives and social situations experienced by citizens have changed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. It was found that overall life satisfaction had decreased substantially in the Australian population, which was mainly caused by the lack of face to face contact people had with their friends and family due to the lockdowns. There are some implications to these findings, as Australia’s social survey lacked several key variables that may have played a role in affecting life satisfaction, and could have also had some non-response bias since surveying was completed online."

This repo contains code and output for a paper about the decreased overall life satisfaction in Australia caused by a lack of face to face contact between people. Data provided by Australia’s General Social Survey containing respondents answers about their lives and social experiences was graphically analyzed and discussed in the paper.
It is organised as follows:
  - inputs contains the several datasets used and analyzed in the paper
  - outputs consists of an rmd file with code and writing, a pdf of the final paper, and a bibliography for references
